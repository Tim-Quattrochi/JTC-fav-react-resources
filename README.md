# JTC React Resources

## Description

This application is a basic collection of resources for learning React and some of React libraries.

## Goal

I'm currently exploring the latest features introduced in React Router v6.4 and above, such as loaders, actions, Form, createBrowserRouter, and Outlet, and hooks. These new functionalities allow for more dynamic and efficient routing in React applications. Additionally, I'm using this opportunity to deepen my understanding and proficiency in TypeScript.

TypeScript enhances the development process by adding static typing to JavaScript, which leads to better code quality, improved developer experience, and fewer runtime errors. By integrating these new React Router features with TypeScript, I aim to create more robust and maintainable web applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tim-Quattrochi/JTC-fav-react-resources.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
